          ðŸ‘‹ Hi {visitor.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + visitor.slice(1)}! I'm Kalu Ogbonnaya Prince, a passionate and
          performance-driven Software Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. With
          over 2 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building fast,
          scalable, and user-friendly web and mobile applications using modern
          technologies like React, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Django, and
          Firebase, mongoDB, mysql. I thrive in solving real-world problems through clean,
          maintainable code and intuitive UI/UX design. Whether it's crafting
          sleek front-end interfaces or architecting backend logic, I love
          turning ideas into impactful digital solutions. ðŸ’¡ Over the years,
          I've:
          â€¢ Managed and contributed to high-impact projects, including
          in-house apps and company websites at Carlton PLC
          â€¢ Delivered multiple full-stack applications â€” from an online store to a crypto tracker
          with live market data.
          â€¢ Collaborated across remote teams, shipped
          features fast, and stayed focused on user needs and performance I'm
          constantly evolving as a developer, currently diving deeper into
          TypeScript, mobile-first development, and backend APIs. I'm also
          PCEP-certified, and I've gained strong foundations through immersive
          coding bootcamps in full-stack and mobile development. Outside of
          coding, I enjoy helping others break into tech, staying updated on dev
          trends, and bringing creativity into every build. Let's build
          something amazing together.

          Technologies I Love:
          JavaScript,
          Python, React, React Native, Tailwind, Django Firebase, API
          integration, Mobile-first design.
